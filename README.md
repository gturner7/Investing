# Investing

The goal of this project was to evaluate a common investment strategy known as "buying the dip." 

/Data contains all relevant data for various historical stock market records

/Code contains an interactive jupyter notebook file where the user can backtest investment strategies using various custom parameters. 

The ultimate finding of this project is that over all three studied time periods, "buying the dip" is almost always worse than a cost-averaging investment approach.
